### Bangalore Home Price Prediction

#### Overview

The Bangalore Home Price Prediction project is a machine learning application built to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various input parameters such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model trained on real estate data to provide accurate price estimates.

#### Features

- **Predictive Model**: Uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on input features.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and encoding data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared are used to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform for easy access.

#### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for model development and backend logic.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework used for serving predictions and handling user inputs.
- **scikit-learn**: Python library for machine learning tasks including data preprocessing and model training.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies for designing the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
